# Watershed-Real-Estate-Management-Profits
Watershed Real Estate Project

In this project, I built a relational schema for Watershed's database, retrieved data from Watershed's current properties, their characteristics and rents, and I integrated this data with external data on short-term property rents to show how Watershed's properties would fare if they are converted from long-term to short-term properties. 

The method involves multiple joins and subqueries, etc.
